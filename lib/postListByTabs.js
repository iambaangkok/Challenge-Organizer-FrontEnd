                1. The competition will be played in a best-of-five games format. The player who wins three games first will be declared the winner of the match.
                
                2. Each game will be played up to 11 points, and the player who reaches 11 points first, with a lead of at least two points, will win the game.
                
                3. The server will serve two points in a row, and then the serve will switch to the other player. If the score is tied at 10-10, players will alternate serving after every point until one player has a two-point lead and wins the game.
                
                4. The ball is considered in play when it touches any part of the table. A ball that hits the net and lands on the opponent's side of the table is considered a valid return.
                
                5. A player can only touch the ball once before it crosses the net, and the ball must be returned over the net and land on the opponent's side of the table.
                
                6. Players must use their own paddles, and the use of any foreign object or substance on the paddle is prohibited.
                
                7. Players must play in the designated playing area and must not obstruct their opponent's view or movement.
                
                8. If a player touches the table with their free hand or body, the opponent will receive a point.
                
                9. If the ball hits the ceiling or any other obstacle before landing on the opponent's side of the table, the opponent will receive a point.
                
                10. If a player serves out of turn, they will lose the point.
                
                11. Players must call their own faults, such as touching the net with their paddle or hand, hitting the ball out of bounds, or failing to make a valid return.
                
                12. Any disputes will be resolved by the referee, whose decision will be final.
                
                By participating in the ping pong competition, all players agree to abide by these rules and any additional rules set forth by the competition organizers.`,
